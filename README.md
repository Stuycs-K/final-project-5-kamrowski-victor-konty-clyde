## Overview
Minesweeper

This is original minesweeper. The goal of the game is to uncover all tiles except the tiles that are mines. 
When a tile is clicked on, it will display it's properties. If it is not a mine, it will display the number of maines adjacent to it (including diagonals).
If it is a mine, you lose, and it will display the mine and the lose screen. 
When you have clicked on all tiles that are not a mine without clicking on a mine, you win.
The aesthetic and rules are made to mimic the original minesweeper, not any newer variants. All features from the old minesweeper are in this version. 
## Instructions

- When opening the game, press either '1', '2', or '3' to begin, despending on what difficulty you want the game to be at. 
- Press 'r' to reset back to the home screen. 
- If you believe a tile is a mine, you can right-click the tile to place a flag on it. To remove the flag, Left-click the tile. 
- If you are sure a tile isn't a mine, you can left click on the tile to click on it. 
- When clicked, it'll display the number of neighbors that are mines. If it was a mine, you lose! 
- When you win, a best time for the mode will pop up. Play again to beat it!

## Overview
Minesweeper

This is original minesweeper. The goal of the game is to uncover all tiles except the tiles that contain mines. 
To uncover a tile, left click the tile. If it is clear, it will display the number of maines adjacent to it (including diagonals).
If it is a mine, you lose. 
If you believe a tile is a mine, you can right-click the tile to place a flag on it. To remove the flag, Left-click the tile.
When you have clicked on all tiles that are not a mine without clicking on a mine, you win. A best time for the mode will pop up.
